#### Euler's Project Q1-Q10

1. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

   ```python
   def Euler1(N):
     " failed at larger N due to large rounding error in python3"
       m3 = [i*3 for i in range(int((N-0.1)//3)+1)]
       m5 = [i*5 for i in range(int((N-0.1)//5)+1)]
       rs = set(m3+m5)
       print (sum(rs))
   
   def Euler1(N):
     " algorithmic approach - all pass"
   	m3 = int((N-0.1)//3)
   	m5 = int((N-0.1)//5)
   	m15 = int((N-0.1)//15)
   	m3_sum = 3*(1+m3)*m3//2
   	m5_sum = 5*(1+m5)*m5//2
   	m15_sum = 15*(1+m15)*m15//2
   	rs = m3_sum+m5_sum-m15_sum
   	print (rs)
   ```

2. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

   By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed N (<four million), find the sum of the even-valued terms.

   ```python
   def genFib(x):
     # F(1)=0, F(2)=1
   	# F(n) = F(n-1)+F(n-2) 
   	a, b = 0, 1
     even = 0
   	l = [a] # fib list
   	while b <= x:
   		a, b = b, a+b
   		if a%2 ==0:
   			even+=a
   	#l.append(a)
   	return even
   ```

   

3. The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

   What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

   ```python
   def LargestPrime(n):
   	'''start with largest prime number'''
   	maxPrime = 1
     # if remove multiples of 2
   	while n % 2 == 0:
   		maxPrime = 2
   		n = n // 2
   	# n must be odd here
   	for i in range(3,int(n**0.5)+1,1):
   		while n % i ==0: # remove all multiples of i
   			n = n // i
   			maxPrime = i
   						
   	if n > 2:        # normally i=1, except if residual is n
   		maxPrime  = n
   	return maxPrime
   ```

   

4. A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

   Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers which is less than N.
   
   ```python
   def panlidromic(x):
   	maxP = 1
   	for i in range(int(x**0.5),100,-1):
   		for j in range(min(x//i,999),100,-1): #3 digits
   			p = i*j
   			if p > maxP:
   				s = str(p)
   				if s == s[::-1]:
   					maxP = max(maxP, p)
   #					print (p,i,j)
   				
   	print ('max= ',maxP)
   	if maxP <=1:
   		return None
   	else:
   		return maxP
   ```
   
5. 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

   What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

   ```python
   --------------- #  without using GCD # -----------------------
   def smallest_divider(x):
   	'''find all primes <= x '''
   	prime = {}
   	product = 1
   	prime[2] = int(math.log(x,2))
   	x = x - 1 if x % 2 == 0 else x # start with odd number
   	for a in range(x,1,-2):
   		f = []
   		for i in range(int(a**0.5),2,-1):
   			while a % i == 0:
   				a = a//i
   				f.append(i)
   		if a > 2:
   			f.append(a)
   			
   		for i in set(f):
   			prime[i] = max(prime.get(i, 0), f.count(i))		
   		
   	for k, v in prime.items():
   		product = k**v*product
   	# e.g prime = {2:3,3:1,5:1,7:1}
   	print (product)
     
    --------------- #  with GCD # -----------------------
   def gcd(x,y):
   	while y!=0:
   		x,y=y,x%y
   	return x
   
   def smallest_divider(x):
   	'''p = A X B / gcd(A,B)'''
   	p = 2**int(math.log(x,2))
   	for a in range(3,x+1,1):
   		p = a*p//gcd(a,p)
   	print (p)
   ```

   

6. The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

   $1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385$

   The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

   $(1+2+...+10)^2=55^2=3025$

   Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025−385=2640.

   Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

   ```python
   1 + 2 + ……….. + n = n(n+1) / 2
   1^2 + 2^2 + ……… + n^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1) / 6
   def calculation(N):
   	return (N*(N+1)//2)**2-N*(N+1)*(2*N+1)//6
   
   ```
