#### Euler's Project Q1-Q10

1. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

   ```python
   def Euler1(N):
     " failed at larger N due to large rounding error in python3"
       m3 = [i*3 for i in range(int((N-0.1)//3)+1)]
       m5 = [i*5 for i in range(int((N-0.1)//5)+1)]
       rs = set(m3+m5)
       print (sum(rs))
   
   def Euler1(N):
     " algorithmic approach - all pass"
   	m3 = int((N-0.1)//3)
   	m5 = int((N-0.1)//5)
   	m15 = int((N-0.1)//15)
   	m3_sum = 3*(1+m3)*m3//2
   	m5_sum = 5*(1+m5)*m5//2
   	m15_sum = 15*(1+m15)*m15//2
   	rs = m3_sum+m5_sum-m15_sum
   	print (rs)
   ```

2. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

   By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

   ```python
   F(1)=1, F(2)=1   # stop at
   F(n) = F(n-1)+F(n-2) #formula
   
   
   ```

   

3. The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

   What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
   
   

4. A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

   Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
